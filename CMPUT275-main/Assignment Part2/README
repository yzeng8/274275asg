Notes:
In the assignment PartII, a client-server model is built. Now we are able to visualize the path between 2 points on a visible graph.

How to use:
1. Go to sub-directory in server and enter make in the command window
2. Go back to the soln directory, enter make run, now you should be able to see a graph of edmonton map
3. click random 2 points on the graph, then the path will be printed to the command window and we should be able to see lines showing the path between 2 points
4. repeat step 3 or exit
5. if want to rerun the program, make sure to make clean first then repeat step 1- 4
