ooclassifer.py

Notes:
The python file ooclassifier.py extends the ooclassifierbase.py which uses the object-oriented programming. By adding additional functionality, ooclassifier.py is able to preprocess the words, count the frequency, and classify using both n-folds validation and one-fold validation

The preprocess includes:
1. Covert to lowercase
2. Remoce all non-alphanumeric character
3. Remove all numbers unless it's entirely number
4. Remove stopwords.
Also, we have 3 different modes which are keep-digits, keep-symbols and keep digits

The word frequency will count the frequency of each words and return the top 5 frequencys and use its word as the target words. if the latter one has the same frequency as the the fifth frequency, we also include it as the target word.

Cross validation will first split the training sets into 3-folds for the previous validation. Then we deepcoied the initial training set. Finally we created a method to add new training sets.

Dicussion:
Discussed with Xiangpeng Ji about part 3.
