freq.py

Notes:
The python file freq.py will read the word input from a text file and count the frequency of each word. The output will be put into a different text file called '<input_filename>.out'. 


To use it:
1. First move your test file and freq.py into the same directory.
2. Use terminal to change directory into the directory you just did.
3. Put the name of the filename into the  terminal as shown "python3 freq.py <inputfilename>" or create an makefile for simpler solution.
4. Note that the input file should be exact 1 file, else our validator will show error.
