preprocess.py

Notes:
The python file preprocess.py will read the text input and preprocess the word. The output will be printed.
The preprocess includes:
1. Covert to lowercase
2. Remoce all non-alphanumeric character
3. Remove all numbers unless it's entirely number
4. Remove stopwords.
Also, we have 3 different modes which are keep-digits, keep-symbols and keep digits

To use it:
1. First enter python3 preprocess.py in the terminal, if using different modes, please then enter one of (keep-digits, keep-symbols and keep digits). Or create a  makefile for simpler solution
2. The final output will be printed.
